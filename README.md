# Facial-Recognition-Project

### Overview
Welcome to the Facial-Recognition-Project, created as part of the BWSI CogWork 2024 program. In this project, we use facial recognition techniques to detect and match faces from images. The system works by loading images, adding them to a database, and identifying people in group photos based on previously stored images.
